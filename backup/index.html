                        Brandon E. Martinez, more famously known as Bem, is a Computer Science student at the University of Notre Dame, navigating the intricate world of technology with a blend of enthusiasm and a healthy dose of self-awareness. A die-hard Philadelphia sports fan (ahhh the sixers...), he also finds solace in the rhythmic waves of the Jersey Shore, the immersive world of music (just j.cole), and the competitive thrill of footy and basketball. To distract himself form the inevitable takeover of A.I, he channels his energy into full-stack development projects, driven by a desire to create and innovate.
                        </p>
                        <p class="info-paragraphs">Brandon's software engineering journey began in the hallowed halls of PC gaming. From meticulously crafting custom gaming rigs throughout middle and high school, he transitioned into the digital realm of Java, where he gained beginner-level experience contributing to open-source Minecraft mods and server plugins. His formal introduction to programming arrived with AP Computer Science Principles and JavaScript, laying the groundwork for his academic pursuits.</p>
                        
                        <p class="info-paragraphs">At Notre Dame, Brandon has immersed himself in the intricacies of computer science. During his freshman year, while exploring various build clubs, he dedicated most of his time to Domer Rover, the University Rover research club, where he began to apply his developing programming skills. He also took his first programming class, focused on MATLAB and Python, culminating in his Energy Analysis Project. Now, as a sophomore, he has further developed his proficiency in his most frequenlty used languages: Python, C, and C++. He's actively contributed to projects like the P&G Review Prediction project through the ND Data Club and currently serves as the Autonomous Navigation Lead for Domer Rover, where he grapples with the challenges of autonomous robotics. He's also ventured into the realm of front-end development, crafting his personal website with React and Next.js. Currently, he's exploring the depths of audio analysis, utilizing Electron.js and Flask/FastAPI, while simultaneously diving into machine learning projects in C++ and Python, including a code completion project for VIM and audio recognition software.</p>
        
                        <p class="info-paragraphs">His academic focus on embedded systems and low-level software engineering provides a robust foundation for his interdisciplinary projects, which span artificial intelligence, machine learning, audio analysis, and much more. He prides himself on being able to understand the entire stack of a project, from the low level hardware, all the way to the front end designs.</p>
        
                        <p class="info-paragraphs">Beyond the code, Brandon's journey is a tapestry of eclectic experiences. It includes a classic PC gaming phase, fueled by countless hours of Linus Tech Tips and GPU benchmark comparisons (all that just to run mineraft with shaders). High school was a period of personal growth, marked by the cultivation of his signature curls, a deep appreciation for the genius of Kanye West (MBDTF is, and always will be, his best), and a firm belief that he was the funniest guy on campus (seriously, ask around). He humorously notes that while he may not have "peaked" in high school, he certainly avoided the fate of those who never even reached their potential (cope).</p>
        
                        <p class="info-paragraphs" style="margin-bottom: 200px;">As a first-generation Mexican-American, Brandon acknowledges the challenges faced by his family, but emphasizes the unwavering support and values instilled by his parents. Their hard work and dedication shaped him into the person he is today, fostering a strong sense of pride in his heritage. He navigated the college application process with a memorable double-deposit incident. A testament to his indecisiveness, however a move he (the laws) strongly advises against. Currently, he balances challenging academic pursuits with a healthy dose of self-deprecation and a commitment to pushing the boundaries of technology. He is also a firm believer that AI will not take his job, but if it does, he will just become a comedian.</p>
